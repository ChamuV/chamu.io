          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            During my gap year after high school — right in the middle of the COVID lockdown — 
            I suddenly had a lot more time at home. I came across a series of DIY robotics buggy 
            videos online and decided to try building my own using an old Raspberry Pi left over 
            from a physics project.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a small experiment grew into a three-month build involving design, 
            wiring, motor control, and software. By the end, I had a Raspberry-Pi-powered buggy 
            that could connect to my phone, follow live commands, avoid obstacles, and stream 
            a camera feed for remote navigation. It was the first time I properly combined 
            hardware and software in a single project, and it became a solid introduction 
            to robotics and embedded systems.

          <h3>Reference</h3>
          <p>
            This project was originally inspired by the official Raspberry Pi tutorial:<br>

              🔗 Raspberry Pi — Build a Buggy
            </a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card" style="margin-top:1rem;">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            The buggy was built following the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s 
            <em>Build a Buggy</em> guide. The core idea was simple: assemble a small 
            two-wheel robot platform, wire the motors to a motor controller board, 
            and then program the movement using Python.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            The basic version of the buggy required only a small set of components:
          </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi with GPIO header</li>
            <li>Motor controller board</li>
            <li>2× DC motors with wheels</li>
            <li>Ball caster for stability</li>
            <li>4× AA battery pack</li>
            <li>Jumper wires and tape</li>
            <li>A simple cardboard or plastic chassis</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
            Once the wiring was complete, I programmed the buggy to move using Python:
            forward, backward, turning, and running simple movement sequences.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            After completing the basic buggy, I explored extensions using additional 
            sensors. I added two <strong>line-following infrared sensors</strong> and 
            experimented with an <strong>HC-SR04 ultrasonic “sonar” distance sensor</strong>
            to detect objects and measure how far obstacles were from the buggy.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            I later discovered that I could pair the buggy with an Android app called 
            <strong>Big Dot</strong>, which sends continuous direction commands over Wi-Fi. 
            By combining the app’s live control with the ultrasonic sensor’s distance checks, 
            I made the buggy <strong>follow me around</strong>: the phone kept it moving 
            toward me, and the sonar sensor stopped it or redirected it whenever it detected 
            an obstacle or got too close.
          </p>
        
          <p>
            This simple setup created a basic “follow-me while avoiding obstacles” behaviour, 
            all built from inexpensive components and a few Python scripts.
          </p>

          <h3>Extensions</h3>
          <p>
            A few ideas I considered for taking the buggy further, both in hardware and behaviour:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Face-recognition following</strong> — use a camera feed to recognise different people and adjust following speed or behaviour for each.</li>
            <li><strong>Drone version</strong> — explore building an aerial variant with similar control logic, using lightweight motors and IMU stabilisation.</li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous mapping</strong> — combine wheel odometry with the ultrasonic sensor to sketch a simple map of a room while navigating it.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice-controlled movement</strong> — add basic speech commands (“forward”, “stop”, “left”) for hands-free operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Web dashboard</strong> — create a browser-based interface with live camera feed, control buttons, and sensor readouts.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
