          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            After finishing my master’s in mathematics, I realised how much I enjoyed the computational
            parts of my dissertation and wanted to strengthen my foundations in computer science.
            I enrolled in a small introductory CS course—and the very first project was to build a
            modified version of the classic game <em>Battleships</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had never played Battleships before, so implementing it from scratch was a completely new
            experience. But it turned out to be an excellent exercise in thinking carefully about
            <strong>functions, logic, data structures</strong>, and disciplined program flow.
            Even though the game itself is simple, building it end-to-end felt like genuinely useful practice.

          <p>
            This project formed part of the <strong>University of London PGCert in Computer Science</strong>,
            and was included as a mid-term assessed assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specification required the game to follow a very precise text-based interaction protocol,
            including strict rules for ship placement, rotation, adjacency, hit detection, and sinking logic.

            <h3>Description</h3>
          
            <p>
              The task was to implement a fully text-based version of the classic game 
              <strong>Battleships</strong>. The game has two stages. 
              <strong>Player&nbsp;1</strong> begins by placing ships on a hidden 10×10 grid, and
              <strong>Player&nbsp;2</strong> then fires at grid locations in an attempt to sink them.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Player&nbsp;1 can place two types of ships:
            </p>
          
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Destroyer</strong> — occupies 2 squares in a straight line. It is sunk when 
                <em>both</em> squares are hit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Battlecruiser</strong> — occupies 5 squares in a fixed “L-shaped” pattern. 
                It is sunk when either all three squares on its <em>long side</em> are hit, or both 
                squares on its <em>middle axis</em> are hit.
              </li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>
              Ship placement is restricted by three rules:
            </p>
          
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Boundary rule:</strong> every part of the ship must lie within the 10×10 board.</li>
              <li><strong>No overlap:</strong> ships cannot occupy the same square.</li>
              <li><strong>No adjacency:</strong> ships may not touch — even diagonally.</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>
              Once the fleet is placed, Player&nbsp;2 repeatedly enters coordinates to “fire”. Each shot is 
              classified as <em>water</em>, a <em>hit</em>, or a <em>hit that sinks a ship</em> using the rules 
              above. The game ends only once every ship in Player&nbsp;1’s fleet has been sunk.
            </p>

          <h3>Extensions</h3>
          <p>
            This project served as a reminder that even a small collection of well-designed functions is
            sufficient to build a complete game. It was a simple, confidence-building exercise in
            moving from mathematical modelling to practical programming.
          </p>

          <p>If extended, I would explore:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Text-based board visualisation</strong><br>
              Showing the grid live on screen would make the game clearer and more interactive.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Two-player placement and firing</strong><br>
              Allowing both players to place ships and take turns would restore the feel of the classic game.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>AI firing strategies</strong><br>
              Adding a simple heuristic or learning-based AI would enable a “player vs computer” mode.
            </li>
          </ul>
